## State of Nature layers for Water Availability and Water Pollution to support SBTN Step 1: Assess and Step 2: Interpret & Prioritize

Version 2 (July 2024)

This repo is the result of a collaboration between SBTN, WRI, and WWF. It contains the code to generate the two ready-to-use unified layers of State of Nature (SoN) for water -- one for water availability and one for water pollution -- in line with the [SBTN Technical Guidance for Steps 1: Assess and Step 2: Interpret & Prioritize](https://sciencebasedtargetsnetwork.org/resources/) (July 2024). The main outputs contain the maximum values of Water Availability and of Water Pollution as well as the individual indicators' values. This information is available at different spatial resolutions, thus in two data formats: 1) a shapefile with values at HydroBasins (Pfafstetter level 6); and 2) an excel file with values at sub-national divisions (Adm1) and national divisions (Adm0). These datasets and complete documentation are publicly available for download from <https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.12702261> .

These unified layers will make it easier for companies to implement a robust approach, and they will lead to more aligned and comparable results between companies.
